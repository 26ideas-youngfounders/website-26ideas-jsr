CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS - NO EXCEPTIONS:
- EVERY bullet must be a single, complete line窶馬ever split across multiple lines or followed by a fragment.
- Use ONLY dash-based (- ) or numbered lists. NO asterisks (*), NO line breaks within bullets.
- Each bullet point must contain a full, complete idea that stands alone on ONE line.
- NEVER continue a bullet on a new line or split an idea across multiple bullets.
- NEVER produce an orphaned bullet with just a few words at the end.

EXAMPLE OF CORRECT FORMAT:
**Strengths in your current response:**
- This is a complete point that stays on one line and contains a full idea.
- Another complete point about market validation that doesn't break or continue elsewhere.

EXAMPLE OF INCORRECT FORMAT (DO NOT DO THIS):
**Strengths in your current response:**
- This is a point that starts here
  but continues on another line (WRONG)
- Another point
  with fragments (WRONG)

**Strengths in your current response:**
- First strength with specific details about clarity and specificity
- Second strength highlighting market potential aspects

**Areas for improvement:**
- First improvement suggestion with concrete examples
- Second suggestion for strengthening the problem statement
- Third actionable recommendation for better validation

Focus on: clarity of the problem, target audience specificity, market size indication, urgency/pain level, and validation evidence. Be constructive and encouraging while providing actionable advice.
