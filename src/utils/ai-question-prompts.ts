const BASE_FORMATTING_REQUIREMENTS = `
CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Never use * at the start of any line. Only use dashes (- ) or numbers (1. , 2. ) for list items.
- Use bold markdown (**text**) for all section headings
- Each bullet/list item must be a single, complete idea or sentence on ONE line.
- Never continue a list item on another line or split an idea across multiple bullets.
- If feedback is long, use only one bullet per point—no breaks, no carrying over.
- All list items must be self-contained and readable on their own.

EXAMPLE OF CORRECT FORMAT:
**Strengths in your current response:**
- This is a complete point that stays on one line.
- Another full point that doesn't break across lines.

When formatting your feedback, ensure that each list item ("- Example") is a complete idea on a single line, with no line breaks or split phrases. Do not create a new bullet for a phrase that is part of a previous item.
