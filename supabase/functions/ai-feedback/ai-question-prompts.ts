const BULLET_INTEGRITY_INSTRUCTIONS = `
BULLET INTEGRITY REQUIREMENT - MANDATORY:
- Each bullet/list item ("- Example feedback here") MUST be a COMPLETE, self-contained point, all on a SINGLE line.
- Do NOT split a single bullet point across multiple lines‚Äînever spill part of a point onto a new line.
- NEVER emit "orphaned" bullets or lines (e.g. a bullet with just a few words separated from its main point).
- If a bullet point is long, continue the sentence on the same line; if a new point is needed, start a new dash.
- Use ONLY dash-style ("- ") bullets. NO asterisks (*), NO numbered lists, NO other markers.

BAD EXAMPLE (Do NOT do this):
- Good point start
continued here
- Next full point
orphaned words

GOOD EXAMPLE (Do this):
- This is a complete and correctly formatted bullet point, with nothing split over two lines.
- This is another, equally well-formed bullet that contains its entire thought on one line.

RESPONSE FORMAT TEMPLATE:
**Strengths in your current response:**
- [bullet 1: single line, complete point]
- [bullet 2: single line, complete point]

**Areas for improvement:**
- [bullet 1: single line, complete point]
- [bullet 2: single line, complete point]
